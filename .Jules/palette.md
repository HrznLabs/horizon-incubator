**Action:** Always check for long markdown files without TOCs as a quick win.

**Learning:** ASCII art in technical specs is hard to maintain and inaccessible. Mermaid diagrams provide a semantic, code-based way to visualize architecture that is both readable as source and renders beautifully.
**Action:** Replace complex ASCII diagrams with Mermaid charts in technical documentation.
