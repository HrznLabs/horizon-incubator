# Research & Development (R&D)

This directory contains experimental projects, proofs of concept, and research initiatives that are not yet part of the main Horizon production codebase.

## 🧪 Purpose

- **Sandbox Environment**: Test new ideas without affecting the main monorepo.
- **New Technologies**: Experiment with new crypto primitives, frameworks, or tools.
- **Integration Tests**: Standalone tests for complex external integrations.

## 📂 Projects

- **[traditional-payments/](./traditional-payments)** - Research into integrating fiat payment rails via Stripe/Wise/Revolut for on-ramping functionality.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Code in this directory is **experimental**. It may not be audited, stable, or maintained. Do not use in production without migrating to the main `horizon` monorepo first.
